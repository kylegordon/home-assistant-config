# Tin Hut Door Reed Switch Sensor
#
# This device monitors a magnetic reed switch attached to a door in the tin hut.
# The reed switch is NORMALLY CLOSED (NC) - it conducts when the magnet is away,
# and opens when the magnet is present.
#
# Hardware Setup:
#   - Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266)
#   - Magnetic reed switch (NC type)
#   - Reed switch connected between D2 (GPIO4) and GND
#   - Internal pull-up resistor enabled on D2
#
# Operation:
#   - When door is CLOSED: magnet near reed switch → switch OPEN → sensor reads HIGH → reports "OPEN" (door open)
#   - When door is OPEN: magnet away from switch → switch CLOSED → sensor reads LOW → reports "CLOSED" (door closed)
#   
# NOTE: The inverted logic in the common config handles the NC reed switch behavior
# so that Home Assistant sees logical door states (open/closed) correctly.
#
# This sensor will be used for lighting automations in the tin hut and outside lights.

  # Reed switch configuration
  # D2 (GPIO4) is recommended as it supports internal pull-up and is safe for boot
  # Alternative pins: D1 (GPIO5), D5 (GPIO14), D6 (GPIO12), D7 (GPIO13)
